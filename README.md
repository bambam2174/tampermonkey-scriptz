## You-Tube-Like

    The idea behind that userscript is my uncurable forgetfulness.
    I always want to support certain YouTuber I've subscribed with the YouTube-Currency "Likes":
    For example by running a whole playlist without even watching delivers the "Views" but no these sweet "Likes"
    That's why I wrote a userscrip where I can add YouTube-channels to on of two lists.
    The Like list or for those I hate the Dislike list.
    When you are on any clip of a certain channel if you press Alt+L the owner of that channel gets on the like list.
    Every time you watch a clip of him the script will like that clip.
    If you press Alt+L a 2nd time that channel gets added to the Dislike list.
    Every time Alt+L is pressed that channel changes into the other list.

    Script fails on certain YouTube-Layouts other than I usually gets delivered by YouTube

    Have to do some more work on that.

## Update concerning Safari-Browser:
After having installed the Safari extension ***Tamperish for Safari***
which is free in contrast to the original TamperMonkey for â‚¬ 1.99
both ***userscripts*** were working
